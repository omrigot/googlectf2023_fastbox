# The 'static' example demonstrates:
# - separate executor and sandboxee
# - sandboxee already sandboxed, not using google3 and compiled statically
# - minimal syscall policy written with BPF macros
# - communication with file descriptors and MapFd
# - test to ensure sandbox executor runs sandboxee without issue
