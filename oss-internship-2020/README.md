# Sandboxing OSS Internship 2020

With Google offices closed due to the pandemic, this year's interns will be
doing their internship at Google fully remote (see the
[blog post](https://blog.google/inside-google/working-google/google-internships-go-virtual-help-open-source/)).

In addition, most of them are working on open-source projects and develop in the
open.

As part of this effort, the Sandboxed API team decided to host interns as well
in order to provide reusable sandboxes for open-source libraries.

This directory collects our interns' contributions prior to upstreaming. For
projects where this is not feasible, we will eventually move the finished
project into the `contrib` folder directly.
